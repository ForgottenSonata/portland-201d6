Your assignment for the weekend through Monday morning: finish the pizza3001 project.

Don't forget to do your work on a branch in your repo, and to do regular commits!

It is suggested that you take a close look at the project we used for the 'Add a form' code assignment from Thursday's lab. Its structure and functionality (including a design scheme) is what you're after, all the the way down to the form that receives form field data, passes that input through your constructor function to create a new instance, and then renders that new location to your data table by using a render() method that is on the constructor and therefore available to all instances.

### New Technical Goal

-Incorporate a CSS layout or framework into your page to improve the display

### sales-data.html

- This page contains your table (or tables, if you prefer).
- Its purpose is to provide sales information to the business owner, and as such, does not need much styling other than that needed to most effectively convey the information.
- It should link back to the index.html page in some way.

### index.html

- This is the public-facing page for the business, so it needs to have more styling applied. It should be fun and reflect the "experience of the future" as we saw in the user stories earlier in the week.
- This page does not link back to the sales-data.html page.
- Have fun with this page. Make it whimsical and useful.
- It is not necessary for this page to utilize JS. Think of it as comparable to the lab assignment on Friday where you were mainly focused on HTML and CSS.
- You may use a layout scheme that utilizes Flexbox if you want, or a CSS framework such as Skeleton. Or just do all of your layout by hand. It's up to you.
- Think about the things that typically appear on the front page of a restaurant website: indicate the locations (you can make up fake addresses if you want), the hours open, a phone number (say, a fake one like 206-mmm-3001), and anything else you think should be there.
- Jenny has asked that you use ALL of the four images provided in the assets/ directory. Ha ha.
- Come up with a color scheme, and use a custom Google Font via the Quick Use button, it's easy:
