This project is based off of a demo of a Code 201 class project; originally built by Scott Schmidt.
You’ll need to clone this repo to the root level of your ~/CF/201 directory, making sure to avoid putting it inside another project or another repo. https://github.com/codefellows/code-201-add-a-form

### Instructions

- Run and study this code to see how it works and what it does. What we want to do, in general, is add a form to the sales.html page so that data from the form is passed through the cookie stand constructor function and adds a new location to the table.

So, here's some of the steps you'll need to take, but not necessarily in this order:

- Add the necessary HTML to create the input form.
- Don't forget <fieldset>!
- Use the constructor function as your guide to determine what input fields your form needs (hint: also consider what is passed in when creating instances!)
- Your JS will need an event listener and and event handler
- Are you going to do any error correction on input? You should.
- Build incrementally. Test frequently.
